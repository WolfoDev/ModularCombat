# Modular Combat 

Revival of the old namesake Source Mod
https://store.steampowered.com/app/349480/Modular_Combat/

This version actually differs a lot from the original Source Mod, although keeping the Modules and Experience system almost identical.

#### Here's what is different:
* Only a few modules from the old mod have been implemented in a similar fashion, most modules are either new or very different from the original
* Teams aren't implemented
* Enemies from HL2 EP2 haven't been implemented (due to most people not having its contents) although a few variations to standard Half-Life 2 NPCs have been added
* PvPvE hasn't been implemented, PvP (FFA) and PvE have.
* Enemies no longer spawn in front of you (possibly)
